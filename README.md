# Quick Intro

This notebook has multiple objectives:

- **Learning & Knowledge**: Writing notebooks with code to learn and retain knowledge. Each notebook could result in:
    - Establishing a final cheat sheet to remember key functions and usage, written in Markdown.
    - Serving as a final cookbook, which can be "RAG-ed" by an AI to generate customized code.
- **Starting & Evaluating**: Doing some quick iterations in new projecs :
    - A package containing some modules as pre-expl. automatised analysis in a OOP fashion (suggestions to convert, anomalies, convert, ), dataviz functions, etc..
    - A scrapping project to get some librairies docs & tutorials scrapped and then used in a RAGGED with Free IA (Mistral? or low cost GPT? local IA?)
